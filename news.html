	<h1>News</h1>
	<h2>2019-04-14: ARAnyM 1.1.0 released</h2>
	<p>After more than four years there's a <a href="https://github.com/aranym/aranym/releases/">new release</a> with tons of fixes and improvements</p>
	<h2>2018-02-06: ARAnyM wiki moves to GitHub</h2>
	<p>The wiki pages have been moved to <a href="https://github.com/aranym/aranym/wiki">GitHub</a>. This should allow anybody willing to write anything useful about ARAnyM (either brand new or fix/rework the original stuff) to do that now.</p>
	<h2>2017-07-18: ARAnyM moves to GitHub</h2>
	<p>ARAnyM project has been moved to <a href="https://github.com/aranym/aranym/">GitHub</a>. This will ease and hopefully even accelerate new development.</p>
	<h2>2017-02-21: New mailing list</h2>
	<p>ARAnyM gets a new mailing list at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/aranym">Google Groups</a> (because the old privately hosted ones died long time ago).</p>
	<h2>2014-10-17: ARAnyM 1.0.2 released</h2>
	<p>After almost 13 years of development welcome ARAnyM version 1.0!</p>
	<h2>2014-04-13: ARAnyM 0.9.16 released</h2>
	<p>New JIT CPU for 64-bit Linux and Mac OS X, MFPR FPU emulation improvements, Ethernet on Mac OS X and improved NatFeat USB</p>
	<h2>2013-04-15: ARAnyM 0.9.15 released</h2>
	<p>New seamless mouse integration (with Clocky), fix for NFVDI resolution change and more solid NatFeats.</p>
	<h2>2012-09-20: ARAnyM 0.9.14 released</h2>
	<p>New bridging network for Mac users and video fixes for everybody plus middle mouse click for input ungrab.</p>
	<h2>2012-03-23: ARAnyM 0.9.13 released</h2>
	<p>A couple of important bug fixes made in the last four days convinced me to make another release.</p>
	<h2>2012-03-19: ARAnyM 0.9.12 released</h2>
	<p>New precise FPU emulation core, fully working NF USB, NF clipboard for BeOS. Several minor fixes and one important fix of CPU CAS instruction emulation.</p>
	<h2>2011-02-06: ARAnyM 0.9.11 released</h2>
	<p>Few small fixes. Better BeOS/Haiku support.</p>
	<h2>2010-05-27: ARAnyM 0.9.10 released</h2>
	<p>This version fixes two nasty crashes in HostFS introduced in previous version. It also brings GEM <-> Host clipboard interconnection.</p>
	<h2>2009-09-05: ARAnyM 0.9.9 released</h2>
	<p>Even more fixes all over the place. Best of all - this ARAnyM does no longer crash due to a (now known) bug in libSDL! If previous ARAnyM has ever crashed on you please upgrade to this version and give it another try.</p>
	<h2>2009-04-25: ARAnyM 0.9.8beta released</h2>
	<p>Fixes, fixes, fixes... CPU, DSP, VIDEL, IKBD, FPU (for JIT), parallel port and last but not least, better handling of mouse grab/ungrab.</p>
	<h2>2008-12-26: AFROS on TOS and new DMG package for Mac OS X</h2>
	<p>I have just uploaded a new DMG package made by Francois that is supposed to contain the necessary SDL libraries - mainly the SDL_image one that is required for boot logo and nfJPEG support (that new AFROS makes use of).</p><p>And in the AFROS download area you'll find a new small zip file called AFROSonTOS that will allow you to boot the stock AFROS on your TOS. This can be useful in case you need to check certain software under AFROS and that software suffers from EmuTOS' only partial or even completely missing support for certain HW or SW features (e.g. DSP)</p>
	<h2>2008-12-17: New ARAnyM+AFROS Live CD released!</h2>
	<p>It's been more than 4 years since the last (and also first) Live CD release so I decided to spend another couple weeks on preparing a brand new Live CD for you! This is based on a modern Slax Live CD so it should work properly on your new PC hardware. It autodetects the networking, obtains an IP address via DHCP and boots directly to a GEM desktop with internet working. Enjoy and let me know your success stories :-) More information about the Live CD is <a href="http://srv1.trusted.cz:4433/pipermail/cz-bobek-lists-aranym-user/2008-December/004028.html">in this mail post</a>. The ISO image is in a separate <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41106&package_id=303156">download area</a>.</p>

	<h2>2008-12-17: AFROS 8.12 released</h2>
	<p>A fresh new AFROS with new versioning (Ubuntu-like year.month), lots of new software, ready to browse internet, write mails, view images, watch movies, listen to music and more! Would you like comparing ARAnyM speed? Use the included Kronos and post your best results :-) Detailed information about the new AFROS is <a href="http://srv1.trusted.cz:4433/pipermail/cz-bobek-lists-aranym-user/2008-December/004027.html">here</a>. AFROS has got its own <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41106&package_id=303153">download area</a> now.</p>

	<h2>2008-11-08: ARAnyM 0.9.7beta released</h2>
	<p>Patrice seems to be increasing the ARAnyM's usability for Falcon games - DMA sound, joysticks and joypads.. and so much hard work put into bugfixing DSP? There were of course regular fixes at various areas including improved automatic network setup on Mac OS X, SDL GUI clicks were fixed, keyboard scancodes corrected and more.</p>

	<h2>2008-01-29: ARAnyM 0.9.6beta2 released</h2>
	<p>In short: much faster graphics output, Mac OS X supported better than ever (JIT on IntelMac, networking and more!), coming with ARAnyM logo+icons and usual bunch of bug fixes and improvements.
	<h2>2007-07-23: AFROS 0.9.5-3 released</h2>
	<p>AFROS with new HighWire using TrueType fonts and best of all - with working network/internet connection. Boot it up and browse Web now :-) <a href="download.html">Download...</a>
	<h2>2007-07-09: ARAnyM 0.9.5beta released</h2>
	<p>New release brings major speed up of the MMU version. FreeMiNT with MMU or Linux-m68k can be run on an average ARAnyM machine faster than on any real MC680x0 now. Mac OS X target has been improved and many smaller bugs have been fixed. Download it while it's hot. Also slightly updated AFROS 0.9.5 is available...
	<h2>2006-11-28: ARAnyM 0.9.4beta2 released</h2>
	<p>New release fixes couple of CPU/FPU and other bugs. Download at usual place. New AFROS is being prepared and will be available soon.
	<h2>2006-09-24: ARAnyM 0.9.4beta released</h2>
	<p>Yes, after 7 months there is a new release. You can download source tar ball, binary for MS-Windows and most notably new AFROS package built using our new cool bootstrapping feature. It's no longer a disk image black-box, now you can copy files around easily even in host OS! Follow this <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41106&package_id=33298&release_id=449571">direct link to download</a>.</p>
	<h2>2006-03-04: CVS links corrected</h2>
	<p>On <a href="development.html">Development page</a> I have corrected URLs to point to our new domain aranym.org. Also added a direct link to CVS web interface.</p>
	<h2>2006-02-28: Pack 3D</h2>
	<p>Added link to Pack 3D in Links</p>
	<h2>2006-02-20: new domain, new documentation, new release</h2>
	<p>ARAnyM now runs on its own domain: <a href="https://aranym.github.io">aranym.org</a></p>
	<p>Documentation is now available in a <a href="https://github.com/aranym/aranym/wiki">Wiki</a> for easier editing.</p>
	<p>New release 0.9.3beta is available for download. Binaries will appear shortly. Updated Atari drivers are available <a href="http://aranym.github.io/bin">here</a> for now - we'll provide a ZIP package later.</p>
	<br />
	<h2>2005-11-03 : mailing lists are back</h2>
	<p>We've lost the 'bobek.sh.cvut.cz' server so our mailing lists haven't been working in past few days. Now Tonda has finished migrating them to a new server. Old e-mail addresses still work but you can also start using the new ones: aranym@ and aranym-user@ lists.bobek.cz.</p>
	<h2>2005-08-25</h2>
	<p>Linux-m68k kernel has been patched to support the Native Features and on top of that new NatFeat based Ethernet driver for linux kernel has been written. Thanks to that you can enjoy networking in Linux-m68k running on ARAnyM. Patch and precompiled kernel 2.4.27 are available <a href="http://web.zln.cz/~joy/linux-natfeats.tar.gz">here</a>.</p>
	<h2>2005-05-08</h2>
	<p><a href="http://aranym.xylab.cz/">ARAnyM Space Today</a> added to Links.</p>
	<h2>2005-04-24</h2>
	<p>AFROS has been updated with new fVDI engine (gcc build) and bugfixed fVDI, HostFS and NFJPEG drivers. Of course EmuTOS is the latest from CVS. And for Windows users there is new ARANYM.BAT file for easier AFROS start up. Copy it to your ARAnyM folder and run it from there.</p>
	<h2>2005-04-14</h2>
	<p>ARAnyM 0.9.0final has just been released. Not many changes since last beta. One important fVDI bugfix included. And documentation has been updated - please try to read it, thanks.</p>
	<h2>2005-04-03</h2>
	<p>AFROS has been updated with new components. Also the disk image has been enlarged to 8 MB.</p>
	<h2>2005-02-26</h2>
	<p>ARAnyM v0.9.0beta2 and AFROS 0.9.0 have been released. Binaries for all main platforms are available for immediate <a href="download.html">download</a>. This release brings many major <a href="http://www.sophics.cz/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/aranym/NEWS?view=markup">new features</a>.</p>
	<h2>2005-01-16</h2>
	<p>I have changed source code snapshots to be generated hourly to reflect the recent fast development pace.</p>
	<h2>2005-01-09</h2>
	<p>Daily source code snapshots are generated again (this time on my server).</p>
	<h2>2004-11-18</h2>
	<p>ARAnyM v0.8.11beta has been released earlier but I've been waiting for Windows package in the download area before posting this announcement. Also make sure you give the Xa-My-AES disk image a try (see <a href="links.html">Links</a>). An updated AFROS is being made as you read this and will be uploaded real soon..</p>

	<h2>2004-08-09</h2>
